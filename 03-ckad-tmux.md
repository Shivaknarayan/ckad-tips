## Sample CKAD Application Deployment Questions and Answers

### Application Deployment â€“ 20%

- Use Kubernetes primitives to implement common deployment strategies (e.g. blue/green or canary)
- Understand Deployments and how to perform rolling updates [\*\*](https://github.com/jamesbuckett/ckad-questions/blob/main/03-ckad-deployment.md#03-01-create-a-namespace-called-deployment-namespace-create-a-deployment-called-my-deployment-with-three-replicas-using-the-nginx-image-inside-the-namespace-expose-port-80-for-the-nginx-container-the-containers-should-be-named-my-container-each-container-should-have-a-memory-request-of-25mi-and-a-memory-limit-of-100mi)
- Use the Helm package manager to deploy existing packages

#### 03-01. Create a namespace called `deployment-namespace`. Create a Deployment called `my-deployment`, with `three` replicas, using the `nginx` image inside the namespace. Expose `port 80` for the nginx container. The containers should be named `my-container`. Each container should have a `memory request` of 25Mi and a `memory limit` of 100Mi.

```bash
clear
# Create the namespace
kubectl create namespace deployment-namespace
```

```bash
clear
# Switch context into the namespace so that all subsequent commands execute inside that namespace.
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=deployment-namespace
```

```bash
clear
# Run the help flag to get examples
# kubectl create deployment -h
kubectl create deploy -h | more
```

Output:

```
Examples:
  # Create a deployment named my-dep that runs the busybox image
  kubectl create deployment my-dep --image=busybox

  # Create a deployment with a command
  kubectl create deployment my-dep --image=busybox -- date

  # Create a deployment named my-dep that runs the nginx image with 3 replicas
  kubectl create deployment my-dep --image=nginx --replicas=3 ### This example matches most closely to the question.

  # Create a deployment named my-dep that runs the busybox image and expose port 5701
  kubectl create deployment my-dep --image=busybox --port=5701
```

```bash

```bash
# Edit the YAML file to make required changes
vi q03-01.yml
```

```bash
clear
# Apply the YAML file to the Kubernetes API server
kubectl apply -f q03-01.yml
```

```bash
clear
# Quick verification that the deployment was created and is working
kubectl get all
```

Output:

```

#### 03-02. In the previous question a Deployment called `my-deployment` was created. Allow network traffic to flow to this deployment from inside the cluster on `port 8080`.

<details><summary>show</summary>
<p>

```bash
clear
# Run the help flag to get examples
kubectl expose -h | more
```

Output:

```
Examples:
  # Create a service for a replicated nginx, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose rc nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for a replication controller identified by type and name specified in "nginx-controller.yaml",
which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose -f nginx-controller.yaml --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for a pod valid-pod, which serves on port 444 with the name "frontend"
  kubectl expose pod valid-pod --port=444 --name=frontend

  # Create a second service based on the above service, exposing the container port 8443 as port 443 with the name
"nginx-https"
  kubectl expose service nginx --port=443 --target-port=8443 --name=nginx-https

  # Create a service for a replicated streaming application on port 4100 balancing UDP traffic and named 'video-stream'.
  kubectl expose rc streamer --port=4100 --protocol=UDP --name=video-stream

  # Create a service for a replicated nginx using replica set, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on
port 8000
  kubectl expose rs nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000

  # Create a service for an nginx deployment, which serves on port 80 and connects to the containers on port 8000
  kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --target-port=8000 ### This example matches most closely to the question.

Watch out for the statement from inside the Cluster so this is of type: ClusterIP

Types include:

- ClusterIP (default)
- NodePort
- LoadBalancer
- ExternalName

```bash
clear
# Check that the Service was created
  # Inside the namespace: my-deploment
  # Outside the namespace: my-deployment.deployment-namespace.svc.cluster.local
kubectl get service
```

Output:

```
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
my-deployment   ClusterIP   10.245.79.74   <none>        80/TCP    103s
```

```bash
clear
# A quicker check is to see if the Pod Endpoints are being load balanced
kubectl get endpoints
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

Output:

```
NAME            ENDPOINTS                                         AGE
my-deployment   10.244.0.250:80,10.244.1.132:80,10.244.1.246:80   5m20s
# The three replicas internal endpoints are registered
```

#### 03-03. Create a namespace called `edit-namespace`. Create a deployment called `edit-deployment` with `2` replicas using the `redis` image in namespace. After the deployment is running, alter the containers to use the `nginx` image. Then alter the containers to use the `nginx:1.14.2` image and record the change.

This works but does not record what the change was.
